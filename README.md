# Application for Synopsys R&D Internship ‚Äì Noida Office

## üëã About Me
I'm a B.Tech student in VLSI Design & Technology, graduating in 2025 from Gurugram University. 
I have a strong foundation in digital design and Verilog, with hands-on experience building and debugging core modules like RAM, synchronous FIFO, and a custom RISC-V processor.

## üéØ Why I'm a Good Fit
- I bring a strong R&D mindset, backed by real-world design work and interdisciplinary exploration.
- Completed a custom **RISC-V processor design**, including RTL implementation and architectural block diagrams.
- Designed and simulated **RAM** and **synchronous FIFO** modules in Verilog, with clean timing behavior and functional verification.
- Created detailed **block diagrams** for each project to visualize architecture and data flow.
- Developed **complex state diagrams** for a vending machine FSM, showcasing my ability to model control logic‚Äîeven though code is pending.
- Authored a technical paper on **Triboelectric Nanogenerators (TENGs)** and led a biomedical R&D project on **non-invasive hemoglobin estimation**.
- Experienced in **embedded C++** through Arduino firmware development.
- Strong debugging skills and a methodical approach to edge cases, timing, and simulation.
- Currently gaining exposure to synthesis and physical design tools like Cadence Genus and Innovus, with plans to complete a full RTL-to-GDSII flow.
